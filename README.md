# Project Description
The robot must pick up a box which acts as an "entry key" to the different sections of the track. We will first attempt the **red** path, which is the obstacle course. After dropping off the box to enter the obstacle course, we will reupload code to the robot so that it can navigate the course and retrieve a new box at the end. After picking up the new box, the robotwill follow the red path to the end and turn when it sees the **green** path. Along the green path, there will be another point to drop off the box and reupload code. This reuploaded code will make the robot climb up a *curved* or *straight* ramp. At the top of the ramp, the robot will be ***randomly stopped*** (wtf does this mean) on a raised platform. The robot must then follow coloured paths in the order of **blue**, **red**, and **green** to navigate to the **black** centre that has a ball. Upon reaching the centre, we will reupload code for the robot to shoot the ball towards the **blue** zone of the platform. After this, the robot will go back down the ramp and we will be finished. 

# Initial (Black Path)
The robot will go forward on the black path and pick up the box. After picking up the box, it will move forward until it detects **red**. It will then turn a measured number of degrees towards the right side of the red path. It will keep going forward on the red path to drop off the box. After dropping off the box, it will keep moving forward on the red path and reach the reupload point. At the reupload point, we will reupload coad for the Obstacle Course section.

# Obstacle Course (Red Path)
- Path with sharp turns
- 2 obstructions, one of which is on a turn
- 

# Ramp Traversal (Green Path)


# Target Shooting (Raised Platform)
